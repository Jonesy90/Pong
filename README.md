# Python Pong

# About
Coding along with a YouTuber on this to create the Pong game in Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U).
It is a somewhat simple project, that deals with the logic of moving the ball around and having it bounce off the different paddles and placing in a score and a winner.
